## Required libraries are:
```{R}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)   
library(data.table)
library(lattice)
```

Loading and preprocessing the data
```{R}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

##1. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{R}
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The mean is 9354 steps and the median is 10395 steps.

## 2. What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{R}
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("5-minute interval") +
  ylab("average number of steps taken")

maxsteps <- max(averages$steps)
```
The 5-minute interval on average across all the days in the dataset with a maximum of 206 steps.

## 3. Imputing missing values

There are numerous NAs in the initial data set, thus need to calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs).

```{R}
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
table(missing)
```
There are 2304 missing data points.

The missing values are imputed by inserting the average for each interval.
```{R}
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```

Using the imputed value, a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day is plotted and the mean and median total number of steps are calculated.
```{R}
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps)
median(total.steps)
```

The values are slightly different compared to the previous (before imputed)
**Before**
Mean is 9354 and median is 10395

**After**
Mean is 10766 and median is 10766

## 4. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Using the dataset with the imputed values:
```{R}
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
  day <- weekdays(date)
  if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
    return("weekday")
  else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
    return("weekend")
  else
    stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN=weekday.or.weekend)
```

Construct panel plot which consists of plots of average number of steps taken on weekdays and weekends.
```{R}
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) +
  xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```

The activity patterns are different between weekend and weekdays as weekends has more peeks of over 100 number of steps compared to weekday. However, weekday has the greatest peak of over 200 number of steps.
